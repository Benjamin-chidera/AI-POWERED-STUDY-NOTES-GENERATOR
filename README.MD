# AI-Powered Study Notes Generator

This project is a web application built with Streamlit that allows users to generate study notes using AI. It leverages LangChain, Pinecone, and other libraries to process PDF documents, extract text, and create vector embeddings for efficient information retrieval.

## Features

- Upload PDF documents and view them directly in the app.
- Automatically split text into manageable chunks for processing.
- Generate AI-powered study notes from uploaded documents.
- Store and retrieve document embeddings using Pinecone.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework for building interactive UIs.
- **LangChain**: Framework for building applications with large language models.
- **Pinecone**: Vector database for storing and querying embeddings.
- **dotenv**: For managing environment variables.
- **streamlit-pdf-viewer**: For rendering PDF files in the app.
